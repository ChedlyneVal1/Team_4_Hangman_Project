# Team_4_Hangman_Project

The git branching strategy we will be using is going to be based off of a git hub branching strategy

Main Branch: This will be the branch that will house all of the combined work
Feature Branch: This will the branch off of main that you will put your changes

Notes:
Always make your changes on a feature branch.
Make a merge request to merge it into main where others can review
Never make changes to main
